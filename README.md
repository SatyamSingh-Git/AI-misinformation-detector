An opinionated, production-ready toolkit to detect and explain misinformation in short and long-form text using modern NLP, interpretability techniques, and ensemble strategies. Designed for reproducible research, ease of experimentation, and real-world deployment.

- Detects likely misinformation, assigns confidence scores, and surfaces interpretable evidence (rationales, attention maps, SHAP/LIME explanations).
- Flexible architecture: plug in pretrained transformers, lightweight classifiers, or rule-based heuristics.
- Tools for data ingestion, labeling, augmentation, training, evaluation, and deployment (REST API + Docker).

## Demo
A quick demo of the detector on a sample tweet:

```text
Input: "Breaking: Scientists confirm coffee prevents memory loss!"
Prediction: MISINFORMATION (score: 0.92)
Top evidence: ["no peer-reviewed study found", "source is a satirical site"]
Rationales: ["no reputable sources cited", "exaggerated causal claim"]
```

(Replace above with actual demo output from your pre-trained model.)

---

## Features
- Multimodal-ready pipeline for text (tabular/meta features can be included)
- Transformer-based models (BERT family, RoBERTa, DeBERTa) + classical baselines (LogReg, RandomForest)
- Augmentation & synthetic data support (back-translation, paraphrasing)
- Explainability: token-level saliency, SHAP, LIME, attention visualization
- Evaluation: precision/recall/F1, ROC-AUC, calibration plots
- Deployment: FastAPI-based REST service and Docker image
- Reproducible configs (YAML), experiment logging with Weights & Biases / MLflow

---

## Quick start

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- GPU recommended for training (CUDA-compatible)

### Install (local)
1. Clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SatyamSingh-Git/ai-misinformation-detector.git
cd ai-misinformation-detector
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows (PowerShell)
```

3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional:
- To install GPU-specific packages, see `requirements-gpu.txt` (if provided).

### Run the pretrained demo
If a pretrained model or saved weights are included, run the demo script:
```bash
python examples/demo_inference.py --model checkpoints/pretrained --text "This is a suspicious claim..."
```

### Run with Docker
Build:
```bash
docker build -t ai-misinformation-detector:latest .
```
Run (example REST server):
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 ai-misinformation-detector:latest
# then open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

---

## Usage

### Python inference example
Replace `Detector` and model loading with the concrete implementation in this repo:
```python
from aimisinfo import Detector  # adjust import path

# load pretrained detector
detector = Detector.load_pretrained("checkpoints/pretrained")

text = "Study proves chocolate cures cancer!"
result = detector.predict(text)
print(result)
# -> {"label": "misinformation", "score": 0.94, "evidence": [...], "explanations": {...}}
```

### Command line
The repo includes a CLI for batch inference:
```bash
python cli/infer.py --input data/samples.csv --output results/predictions.csv --model checkpoints/pretrained
```

### REST API (example)
Start the API server (FastAPI recommended):
```bash
uvicorn app.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
Example request:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"Aliens found on Mars"}'
```

## Data & Training

### Supported datasets
Common public datasets you can use to reproduce results or train models:
- LIAR / LIAR-PLUS
- FakeNewsNet
- FEVER (for claim verification)
- Custom labeled data (CSV / JSONL format: id, text, label, metadata)

Make sure to document dataset provenance and licensing for any shared datasets.

### Train a model
A generic training command (adjust flags and config paths to your repo structure):
```bash
python train.py --config configs/transformer_train.yaml --output_dir outputs/exp1
```
Configs use YAML. Key config sections:
- model: architecture, pretrained checkpoint
- data: train/val/test paths, batch size
- optimizer: lr, weight decay
- scheduler, augmentation, early stopping, logging

Logging to W&B / MLflow:
```bash
wandb login
python train.py --config configs/transformer_train.yaml --use_wandb True
```

---

## Evaluation
We evaluate on held-out test sets and report:
- Accuracy
- Precision / Recall / F1 (macro & per-class)
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion matrix and calibration curves
- Human-in-the-loop evaluation for explanation quality (if available)

Example evaluation command:
```bash
python evaluate.py --preds outputs/exp1/preds.csv --labels data/test_labels.csv
```

---

## Architecture
High-level modules:
1. Data loaders: ingest CSV/JSONL/Parquet, handle metadata
2. Preprocessing: tokenization, normalization, domain-specific cleaning
3. Feature engineering: embeddings, metadata features, URL/source features
4. Models: transformer encoders, lightweight classifiers (LogReg), ensembling
5. Explainability: SHAP/LIME wrappers, attention visualization, rationale extraction
6. Serving: FastAPI app with batch and single-request endpoints, health checks

## Responsible AI & Limitations
- This tool assists detection but is not an oracle. False positives and negatives will occur.
- Bias: models trained on public datasets can exhibit demographic, topical, or source bias.
- Use model calibration & human review for high-stakes decisions.
- Respect dataset licenses; do not use model outputs to harass or defame individuals.
- Provide transparency: ship model cards and datasheets with any release.

See the [MODEL_CARD.md](./MODEL_CARD.md) (if present) for detailed model behavior, intended use, and evaluation results.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Suggested workflow:
1. Open an issue to discuss major changes.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/awesome-feature`
3. Commit with clear messages and add tests.
4. Open a pull request referencing the issue.

Guidelines:
- Follow the code style (black/flake8/isort).
- Add unit tests for new functionality.
- Keep configs reproducible (seed, deterministic settings).

You can run tests with:
```bash
pytest -q
```
